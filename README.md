# Crypto Assessment
A technical crypto assessment from the IBM Client Center of Montpellier. 

## What is the Crypto Assessment? 
The vision of the Crypto Assessment is to provide a simple, transparent approach to understand and to optimize the use of enterprise encryption capabilities offered by IBM Z technologies to protect both data in-flight and at-rest. Most of the time default settings are used, and it happen that organization miss both their security and performance target.

The Crypto Assessment is an offering proposed by the IBM Client Center of Montpellier. This technical study has been designed to help client to have answer regarding 2 important questions:

:question: **CONFIGURATION REVIEW** - Are my today settings optimized to achieve both my security and performance objectives? *(Protocol setting review, AT-TLS policy review, network connections security assessment, network connections mapping, cipher suite review, openSSH configuration review, ...)*

:question: **PERFORMANCE** - How and where can I optimize performance of the encryption in my environment? *(CipherSuite, Key Exchange, IBM Z instructions adherence, Mode of Operation, Crypto Cards configuration, PFS, ...)*

## Crypto Assessment target audience :bulb:
All IBM Z clients running z/OS who envision to start to protect their data at rest and in motion with their IBM Z are eligible to a the Crypto Assessment study.

## Crypto Assessment benefits and advantages

### Benefits
Starting with on a data collection phase, after a deep analysis of data, the client will know what are steps they still have to make to be ready to protect their data at rest and in motion with encryption. They will get deep insights:
* From the components they will need to configure first, and their setting to optimize the performance
* What are the best practices in terms of crypto configuration, secured network protocols and key management on IBM Z

### Advantages
The Crypto Assessment study requires a limited client investment in time and effort. Client send data, and the IBM team works from these data.

The team in charge of the Crypto Assessment has more than 3 year of customer experience spent in Pervasive Encryption projects, Crypto Assessment and Fast Start with Encryption project on IBM Z. More over, Montpellier Client Center team has more than 10 years of zMAX study and the Crypto Assessment has the similar approach and efficiency (Data collection first, Site client delivery second).

Crypto Assessment is based on a technical study. From our client data we can see everything that matter to evaluate client encryption practices. Their data reveals the following:
* Hardware/Software readiness and encryption capabilities
* OS limitations for encryption capabilities and protocol support
* Available white space for Encryption projects
* Encryption maturity and skills
* How optimized is the crypto environment
* Network architecture, volumes of unsecured network connections
* Network protocols and default setting check

The Crypto Assessment includes two main livrables:
  * 1day on client site summary presentation
  * 50+ pages report

## The Crypto Assessment delivery time :calendar:
The Crypto Assessment starts by contacting the IBM Client Center of Montpelier team.
* Following a formal engagement process and once client and IBM team has an agreement the Crypto Assessment study process can start.
* Client collects technical data and share it with the IBM team (FTPS, ECUREP, IBM BOX...)
* The IBM team checks and validates received data and agrees on a restitution date with the client.
* The IBM team starts to analyse received data.
* The IBM team creates a delivery package made of technical reports, and an exective summary powerpoint presentation.
* The Crypto Assessment study is delivered by the IBM Team on client premises during a 1 day technical workshop.
